QueryJam 🎵
A collaborative data playground where teams can explore, analyze, and visualize data together in real-time.
Features


QueryJam is a revolutionary web-based platform that transforms data analysis into a dynamic, collaborative experience. Imagine Google Docs fused with a powerful SQL playground and an AI co-pilot – that's QueryJam! Designed for data engineers, analysts, and teams, it lets you experiment, iterate, and innovate on data workflows together, without the hassle of local setups or siloed tools.

Whether you're prototyping pipelines, exploring hypotheses, or teaching SQL basics, QueryJam makes data work feel like a creative jam session: fun, fluid, and full of breakthroughs. Powered by real-time syncing, AI suggestions, and seamless integrations, it's the ultimate playground for turning raw data into actionable insights.

Key Features
Real-Time Collaboration: Edit queries, datasets, and visualizations simultaneously with your team – like Figma for data pros. Invite links, role-based permissions, and inline chat keep everyone in sync.
AI-Powered Assistance: Our smart co-pilot auto-completes queries, suggests optimizations, and generates full notebooks from natural language prompts (e.g., "Analyze churn by region"). Levels for beginners to experts ensure accessible power.
Flexible Data Handling: Connect to databases (PostgreSQL, BigQuery), upload CSVs, or generate synthetic datasets on-the-fly. Version snapshots let you test "what-if" scenarios without risking production data.
Built-In Visualizations: Drag query results into interactive charts and dashboards. Export to Jupyter, PDF, or embed in Slack/Notion for effortless sharing.
Secure & Scalable: Sandboxed environments protect sensitive data. Freemium model: Free for small teams, premium for unlimited sessions and custom AI models.
Why QueryJam?
In a world of fragmented tools (Jupyter for solo work, DataGrip for querying, Slack for chatting), QueryJam unites them into one seamless flow. No more emailing notebooks or debugging alone – jam it out live! Perfect for agile data teams, educators, or open-source projects.

Quick Example
SQL
-- Sample Query in a Jam Session
SELECT user_id, SUM(engagement_score) AS total_engagement
FROM user_activity
WHERE date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY total_engagement DESC
LIMIT 10;
AI Suggestion: "Optimize with an index on 'date' for faster runs!"
